# Hacker Statistics

Welcome to my Hacker Statistics repository. Here, I've implemented various exercises that apply concepts of randomness, simulations, and statistical analysis using Python.

## Case Study: Hacker Statistics

I've applied a range of concepts to calculate probabilities and simulate scenarios using hacker statistics techniques. Let's walk through the exercises:

### Random float

I've explored the randomness inherent in Python's `random` package, a submodule of NumPy, to simulate a game by generating random floats within specified ranges.

### Roll the dice

Utilizing functions like `randint()` from the `random` package, I simulated dice rolls to generate integers randomly, setting the stage for subsequent analyses.

### Determine your next move

In the Empire State Building bet scenario, I coded the logic for determining the next move based on the outcome of dice rolls, employing if-elif-else constructs for decision-making.

### How low can you go?

To prevent negative steps in the simulation, I utilized the `max()` function to ensure the step never falls below zero during the random walk simulation.

### Visualize the walk

I visualized the random walk using `matplotlib.pyplot`, creating line plots to illustrate the progression of steps over time.

### Simulate multiple walks

By repeatedly simulating the random walk and collecting results, I gained insights into the likelihood of reaching a specified step target, enhancing the analysis with Python loops.

### Visualize all walks

Converting simulated random walk data into NumPy arrays allowed for more sophisticated visualization techniques, facilitating the comparison and analysis of multiple random walks.

### Implement clumsiness

Incorporating the concept of clumsiness, I introduced a probability of falling down during the random walk simulation, adding another layer of randomness to the scenario.

### Plot the distribution

To understand the distribution of end points of the random walks, I created histograms to visualize the frequency of reaching various step targets, providing valuable insights into the simulation outcomes.

### Calculate the odds

Finally, I calculated the estimated chance of reaching specific step targets based on the distribution of end points generated from the simulation, applying statistical analysis to inform decision-making.
