# Hacker Statistics

This repository contains Python code implementing Hacker Statistics concepts, including simulating random processes, analyzing outcomes, and visualizing results using Matplotlib.

## Overview

Hacker Statistics is a powerful tool for simulating and analyzing random processes. This project utilizes Python's NumPy and Matplotlib libraries to simulate various scenarios and calculate probabilities. By understanding the principles of randomness and employing statistical techniques, we can gain insights into complex systems and make informed decisions.

## Exercise Prompts

### Random Float

Randomness plays a crucial role in numerous fields, from science to gaming. In this exercise, we utilize NumPy's random package to generate random floats and simulate a game scenario.

### Roll the Dice

Expanding on randomness, we explore generating random integers with NumPy's randint() function. This exercise simulates dice rolls, a fundamental aspect of many games and statistical simulations.

### Determine Your Next Move

Building upon the previous exercises, we implement logic to determine the next move in a simulated game scenario. By incorporating if-elif-else constructs, we model decision-making based on random outcomes.

### How Low Can You Go?

In this exercise, we address constraints within the simulated scenario. By using NumPy's max() function, we ensure that the simulated process adheres to specific rules, such as not allowing negative values.

### Visualize the Walk

Visualization is key to understanding simulated processes. We leverage Matplotlib to create line plots, providing insights into the progression of random walks over time.

### Simulate Multiple Walks

To assess the likelihood of achieving a specific outcome, we simulate multiple instances of the random process. By collecting and analyzing the results, we gain a deeper understanding of the underlying probabilities.

### Visualize All Walks

Visualizing multiple simulated walks enables us to explore the distribution of outcomes. By converting data into NumPy arrays and utilizing Matplotlib, we generate informative plots for analysis.

### Implement Clumsiness

Introducing additional complexities, we simulate random events affecting the outcome. By incorporating a probability of failure, we model real-world uncertainties within the simulated scenario.

### Plot the Distribution

Histograms provide a visual representation of outcome distributions. We utilize Matplotlib to create histograms, allowing us to analyze the frequency and spread of simulated outcomes.

### Calculate the Odds

Finally, we calculate the probability of achieving a specific outcome based on the simulated data. By analyzing the distribution of endpoint values, we estimate the likelihood of success in the simulated scenario.
